- Demonstrate proficiency with commonly-used Python programming.
- This project checks a couple of properties for numbers:
  - Integers being prime.
  - Integers being divisible by other integers.
- Some definitions:
  - An integer number is prime if it is greater than 1, and if it can only be divided by 1 and itself.
  - Two integers are relatively prime if they do not have any common divisor other than 1.
